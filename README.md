# Yamini's To-Do List App

A simple To-Do List web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks with persistent storage using `localStorage`.

## Features

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Automatically load saved tasks on page load
- Data persisted using browser `localStorage`

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- localStorage API

## Upcoming 
Simulate saving/loading tasks from a fake API using async/await.

We'll mimic:

- POST /tasks – when a task is added

- GET /tasks – to load saved tasks on page load

- DELETE /tasks/:id – to delete a task

- PATCH /tasks/:id – to mark as done

All using setTimeout + Promises to simulate network delay.
